# Laptop Price Predictor

## Overview

Laptop Price Predictor is a machine learning project designed to predict the prices of laptops based on various features such as brand, processor type, RAM size, storage capacity, and more. This project can be useful for both consumers looking to make informed purchasing decisions and retailers aiming to price their products competitively.

## Features

- Predict laptop prices based on multiple features.
- User-friendly interface for inputting laptop specifications.
- Visualization of the predicted price distribution.
- Supports various machine learning algorithms for accurate predictions.

## Installation

To set up the Laptop Price Predictor on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vinod1543/laptop-price-predictor.git
   cd laptop-price-predictor
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application:**

   python app.py
   ```

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model includes various features of laptops such as:

- Brand
- Processor Type
- RAM Size
- Storage Capacity
- Screen Size
- Graphics Card
- Operating System

Ensure that the dataset is cleaned and preprocessed before training the model. The dataset can be found in the `data` directory.

## Usage

1. **Input Laptop Specifications:**
   - Enter the details of the laptop such as brand, processor type, RAM size, etc.

2. **Predict Price:**
   - Click the "Predict" button to get the estimated price of the laptop.

3. **Visualize Results:**
   - View the distribution of predicted prices and compare with actual prices (if available).

## Model Training

To train the model:

1. **Prepare the dataset:**
   - Ensure the dataset is in the correct format and split into training and testing sets.

2. **Run the training script:**
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

3. **Evaluate the model:**
   - Check the performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), etc.
